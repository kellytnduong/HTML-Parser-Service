# HTML-Parser-Service
A Python service to parse HTML from a card machine into readable text. These files are organized in either a locally or cloud-based database, which can be configured during directory path setup.

Scripts were developed with accessibility in mind. Includes documentation to run on MacOS or Windows using Unix Shell or Command Shell, and does not require additional libraries or PATH configuration other than initial Python download.
